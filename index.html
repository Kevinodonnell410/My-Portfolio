		<h2>Here's why:</h2>
		<div class="reason">
			<h3>Reason 1</h3>
			<p>I'm a patient and competant worker. I can get along with just about anyone. I enjoy working on new task and learning new skills. I also almost never call out of work and have great attendance. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="reason">
			<h3>Reason 2</h3
			<p>I've always had a interest in the tech field, having built my own computer from various kit parts and praticed web design in the past, I've always showed a keen interest.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="reason">
			<h3>Reason 3</h3>
			<p>I enjoy a challenge. I enjoy trying to solve a puzzle that seems both challenging and convulting. There's no better feeling then completing something that seems complex at first but overtime becomes easier.</p>
